# The Ultimate Anime Survey

This repo is the most weeb thing ever! What could it be? Well, it is a survey about anime and anime only. 

## What is it for?

This was originally for freeCodeCamp. But Overtime I will update the design and eventually will code well enough to actually gather the data and create automatic charts from it.

## Why do you like anime so much?

Well, why not? Just as there are terrible animes, there are truly amazing animes that have truly changed my life. I will never give up on loving anime.

## What did you use?

+ jQuery
+ HTML
+ CSS

### Languages I will eventually use for this project

+ Python
+ JavaScript

## Project Goals

+ Have pie charts created automatically from data
+ Be able to retrieve the data
+ Create another page where visitors can access different charts based on existing data, and share with their friends!
